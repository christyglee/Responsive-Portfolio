# Responsive Portfolio

Reponsive portfolio is a website designed to begin showcasing my portfolio and projects as I begin my journey as a web designer. 

With the wonderful resouces provided by Bootstrap, I was able to create and incorporate a responsive web design to automatically adjust to different screen sizes. The purpose of having a responsive web design is to make the page fit well on all devices.

I am excited to share my progress and improve my skillset throughout this experience.

## Coding Process

As a coding beginner, I found this project to be a little difficult to start; however, Bootstrap made it helpful for me to find majority of the source codes to kick-off this project. 

When tackling the "About Me" page, I was having issues with the grid system being too wide to my liking. After many unsuccessful attempts to shrink the width size without using a css stylesheet, I decided to incorporate and wrap Bootstrap's card code with the grid system I currently had in place.

### Updated Portfolio Part 2

I had a lot of fun updating the background picture for my entire site and styling with transparent colors. Adding projects to the portfolio tab was super exciting! Lastly, I included links to my email, GitHub, LinkedIn, and Resume in the contact tab.

### Updated Portfolio Part 3

In this updated portfolio, I deployed to Heroku with Express routes serving up static HTML Pages. In addition, I updated my portfolio tab to include the repository and heroku deployed link of my RooTs - A Social Media Garden project.

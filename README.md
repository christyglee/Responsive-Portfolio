# Responsive Portfolio

Reponsive portfolio is a website designed to begin showcasing my portfolio and projects as I begin my journey as a web designer. 

With the wonderful resouces provided by Bootstrap, I was able to create and incorporate a responsive web design to automatically adjust to different screen sizes. The purpose of having a responsive web design is to make the page fit well on all devices.

I am excited to share my progress and improve my skillset throughout this experience.

## Coding Process

As a coding beginner, I found this project to be a little difficult to start; however, Bootstrap made it helpful for me to find majority of the source codes to kick-off this project. 

When tackling the "About Me" page, I was having issues with the grid system being too wide to my liking. After many unsuccessful attempts to shrink the width size without using a css stylesheet, I decided to incorporate and wrap Bootstrap's card code with the grid system I currently had in place. 

Please view the source code below.

```
      <div class="card w-50">
        <div class="card-body">

          <div class="container">
          <!-- First Row -->  
            <div class= "row">
            <!-- Column in first row -->    
                <div class="col-md-12">
                  <br>
                  <h1 class="text-info"><strong>About Me</strong></h1>
                  <hr>
                </div>
            </div>
          <!-- Second Row -->
            <div class="row">
              <!-- Column in second row -->
              <div class="col-md-12">
                <!-- Image sizing -->
                <img width="275" height="225" src="https://scontent-sjc3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/70850666_10163067927145355_6731032304879140864_o.jpg?_nc_cat=103&_nc_sid=84a396&_nc_ohc=V9cOyL2HSFoAX8JeeRs&_nc_oc=AQmWGIknB7Iqt5DO_bej_za50Y0cKX79cl0gCDFiToRSITlAPuRqnLblKJxawTk86Gw&_nc_ht=scontent-sjc3-1.xx&oh=15fedf0ef2eec2b7596d4a09ad358f72&oe=5F8695B2" alt= "Christy Lee in Sedona National Park"/>
                <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
